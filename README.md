## Description

ParkySpot is an innovative, open-source smart parking management system designed to revolutionize the way drivers find and reserve parking spaces. In an increasingly urbanized world, finding available parking can be a significant source of stress and wasted time, contributing to traffic congestion and pollution. ParkySpot addresses these challenges by providing real-time data on parking spot availability, enabling users to locate, reserve, and navigate to the nearest vacant spot with ease.

This project aims to create a comprehensive platform that benefits both drivers and parking facility operators. Drivers save time and reduce frustration, while operators can optimize their parking space utilization, manage occupancy, and potentially integrate smart sensor technologies. ParkySpot is built with scalability and modularity in mind, making it adaptable for various environments, from small private lots to large public parking structures.

## Key Features

*   **Real-time Availability:** View live updates on parking spot occupancy across registered locations.
*   **Map-based Discovery:** Intuitive map interface to browse available parking spots in your vicinity.
*   **Secure Reservation System:** Book parking spots in advance, ensuring a guaranteed space upon arrival.
*   **Integrated Navigation:** Seamless navigation to your reserved parking spot using popular mapping services.
*   **User Profile & History:** Manage your reservations, view parking history, and save favorite locations.
*   **Admin Dashboard:** (For operators) A powerful dashboard to manage parking zones, monitor occupancy, and view analytics.
*   **Flexible Payment Gateway Integration:** Designed to support various online payment methods for reservations (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
*   **Search & Filter:** Advanced search capabilities to filter parking spots by price, type (e.g., covered, EV charging), and accessibility.

## Technology Stack

ParkySpot is built using a modern, robust, and scalable technology stack to ensure performance and maintainability:

*   **Backend:**
    *   **Python:** The core language for server-side logic.
    *   **Django / Django REST Framework (DRF):** A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. DRF is used for building powerful and flexible Web APIs.
    *   **PostgreSQL:** A powerful, open-source relational database system for storing structured parking data, user information, and reservation details.
*   **Frontend:**
    *   **React:** A declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    *   **Mapbox GL JS / Leaflet.js:** For interactive, customizable maps and geolocation services.
    *   **Axios:** Promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js for API communication.
*   **Containerization:**
    *   **Docker:** For consistent development environments and streamlined deployment.
*   **Other:**
    *   **Git:** Version control.

## Installation

Follow these steps to get ParkySpot up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Git:** For cloning the repository.
*   **Python 3.8+:** For the backend server.
*   **pipenv:** Python package manager for dependency management.
*   **Node.js 14+ & npm/Yarn:** For the frontend application.
*   **PostgreSQL:** A running PostgreSQL instance.
*   **Docker & Docker Compose (Optional, but recommended for production-like setup):** For containerized deployment.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xASR-dev/parky_spot.git
cd parky_spot
```

### 2. Backend Setup (Django)

```bash
cd backend

# Create a Python virtual environment and install dependencies
pipenv install --dev

# Activate the virtual environment
pipenv shell

# Create a .env file from the example
cp .env.example .env

# Open .env and configure your PostgreSQL database connection details:
# DB_NAME=parkyspot_db
# DB_USER=your_db_user
# DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
# DB_HOST=localhost
# DB_PORT=5432

# Apply database migrations
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

# Create a superuser (optional, for accessing Django Admin)
python manage.py createsuperuser

# Go back to the root directory
cd ..
```

### 3. Frontend Setup (React)

```bash
cd frontend

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install # or yarn install

# Create a .env file from the example
cp .env.example .env

# Open .env and configure your backend API URL:
# REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api

# Go back to the root directory
cd ..
```

### 4. Running with Docker (Recommended for Production or Integrated Dev)

For a more integrated setup or production deployment, you can use Docker Compose.

```bash
# Ensure you are in the project root directory (`parky_spot/`)

# Build the Docker images
docker-compose build

# Start the services (backend, frontend, database)
docker-compose up -d

# Run migrations within the Docker container (for the first time or after new migrations)
docker-compose exec backend python manage.py migrate

# Create a superuser (optional)
docker-compose exec backend python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Usage

Once both the backend and frontend services are running, you can start using ParkySpot.

### 1. Start Backend Server (if not using Docker)

Make sure you are in the `backend/` directory and have activated your pipenv shell.

```bash
# From the project root:
cd backend
pipenv shell

# Run the Django development server
python manage.py runserver
```

The backend API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000/api/`.

### 2. Start Frontend Server (if not using Docker)

Make sure you are in the `frontend/` directory.

```bash
# From the project root:
cd frontend

# Start the React development server
npm start # or yarn start
```

The frontend application will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 3. Using the Application

*   **Browse Parking Spots:** The map will display available parking spots based on the data in your database.
*   **Register/Login:** Create a new account or log in to manage your reservations.
*   **Reserve a Spot:** Select a spot on the map, view its details, and proceed to reservation.
*   **Admin Access:** If you created a superuser, you can access the Django Admin panel at `http://localhost:8000/admin/` to manage parking locations, users, and more.
